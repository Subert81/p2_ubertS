//The Harris-Benedict equation estimates the number of calories your body needs to maintain your weight if you do no exercise, which is called the BMR. 
//The formula for the calories needed for a woman to maintain her weight is:
//BMR = 655 + (4.3 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)
//The formula for the calories needed for a man to maintain his weight is
//BMR = 66 + (6.3 x weight in pounds) + (12.9 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in years)
//A typical chocolate bar will contain around 230 calories.Write a program that allows the user to input her or his:
//Gender
//M or m for male
//F or f for female
//Weight in pounds
//Height in inches
//Age in years
//The program should then output
//the number of calories that should be consumed to maintain one's weight for the appropriate gender of the specified weight, height, and age
//the number of chocolates that would be equivalent to the calories thus calculated
//The program must give the user the option to repeat the program or exit.
//Input Validation :
//correct value of the gender(M, m, F or f)
//correct response to whether or not to repeat(Y, y, N or n)
